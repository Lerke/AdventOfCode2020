# How to use

Simply run the application as a .NET 5.0 app. Takes one argument: `<path to input>`

Calculating the one star example output would be
```powershell
$ dotnet run ./exampleinput.txt
Day 13 - Shuttle Search
Path: ./exampleinput.txt
Earliest bus that will depart is at T=944, Bus=59.
You will have to wait 944 - 939 = 5 minutes
Multiplied by Id (*) -> 5 * 59 = 295 minutes
```
