# How to use

Simply run the application as a .NET 5.0 app. Takes one argument: `<path to input>`

Calculating the two star example output would be
```powershell
Day 13 - Shuttle Search
Path: ./exampleinput.txt
Earliest bus that will depart is at T=949, Bus=13.
You will have to wait 949 - 939 = 10 minutes
Multiplied by Id (*) -> 10 * 13 = 130 minutes
Calculating first number where each bus departs at the subsequent corresponding minute as the first one...
First time is at 3417 minutes (**)
