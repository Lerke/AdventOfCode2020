# How to use

Simply run the application as a dotnet 3.0 app. Takes three arguments: `<path to input> <initial x direction> <initial y direction> [<initial x direction> <initial y direction>]*`

Calculating the two star example output would be
```
$ dotnet run ./exampleinput.txt 1 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 1 1
```
