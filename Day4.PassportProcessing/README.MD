# How to use

Simply run the application as a dotnet 3.0 app. Takes three arguments: `<path to input> <initial x direction> <initial y direction> [<initial x direction> <initial y direction>]*`

Calculating the two star example output would be
```
$ dotnet run ./exampleinput.txt 
Day 4 - Passport Processing (*)
Using path: ./input.txt
Number of passports: 260
Number of OK passports: 204
Number of NOK passports: 56
```
